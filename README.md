# Fighter-effciency-prediction
Neural network regression model applied to raw fighter data after preprocessing and feature engineering for efficiency prediction.

firstly i got the data from kaggle : "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajeevw/ufcdata"

performed preprocessing and feature engineering in notebooks -> preprocessing-and-insights.ipynb.

the nn models: 
1. UFC_NN.ipynb -> for predicting the efficicy of the takedown of a fighter (regression model).
2. weightclass_nnmodel.ipynb -> for predicting the weight class of a fighter (classification model).
